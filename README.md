# GA WDI Instructor Challenge

## Comments/Observations

A couple things I noticed while completing this:

### Vanilla JavaScript is not the best intro to AJAX/frontend!

I would likely have a lesson where I teach JavaScript syntax/fundamentals,
before doing an AJAX lesson... and I would probably do the AJAX lesson using
jQuery.

JQuery adds a nice layer of abstraction that would reduce the cognitive load on
students who likely don't have too much experience doing frontend programming.

### Templating engine

I would have used a templating engine like Pug to render the `/favorites` page. 
### CSS

I did not use CSS in this project since I ran out of time. But also, students
should be saving CSS to be the last thing that they touch. I would have students
use Bootstrap.

### Teaching React

Writing an asynchronous website is painful without an MVC library. I would teach
React, since there's a decently large job market for React developers.

The problem is that understanding React requires students to already have a
robust mental model of computing and a good understanding of JavaScript's quirks
(functions, lexical `this`, objects, etc.)... Which, hopefully they would have
by the time they get to the frontend section of the course!

The good thing is that writing this in React (and thus, teaching it) would be
much easier than teaching students how to do it in vanilla JavaScript. I think a
good, natural progression would be

- JavaScript syntax (solving problems students
have already encourntered, but in JavaScript. They'll realize that programming
languages are pretty similar and algorithms are language-agnostic)
- AJAX w/ jQuery
- React (or another MVC)
